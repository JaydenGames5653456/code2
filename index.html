		<h2 class="center">What is sustainable living?</h2>
		<p>Sustainable living is a practical philosophy that aims to reduce personal and societal environmental impact by making positive changes which counteract climate change and other negative environmental concerns.</p>
	</div>
	<div id="difference">
		<h2 class="center">Sustainable Living vs Zero Waste --- what's the difference?</h2>
		<p>The terms sustainable living and zero waste living are often used interchangeably. It’s easy to see why, because the two lifestyles are driven by the same goal – to preserve the planet. 

		Even in practice, there’s plenty of overlap. for example, reducing plastic is always good for the environment, so zero waste practices are inherently also sustainable living ones, too. On the flip side, those aiming for a zero waste lifestyle also tend to adopt other sustainable living habits. 
     
    	While driven by the same underlying motivation, zero waste and sustainable living prioritize lifestyle changes differently.

		Zero waste focuses on the trash problem (at the consumer level) and the closed-loop cycle of production and consumption (at the systematic level). It doesn’t specifically address things like transportation or green superannuation/pension funds to invest in. 

		Those things are domains of sustainable living, a much broader concept that deals with ways to reduce the environmental impact of large scale day-to-day activities that don’t necessarily produce quantifiable or physical forms of waste.</p>
		<h3 class="center">How to start Sustainable Living</h3>
		<p>There are numerous ways to start living more sustainably — and a sustainable lifestyle looks different for everyone. Areas where you can reduce your impact include:</p>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<th>Eating a Plant-Based Diet</th>
            	<th>Composting</th>
            	<th>Reducing Single-Use Plastic</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>
					<ol type="a">
						<p>Animal products like meat, dairy, and eggs are the highest-impact foods on Earth.</p>
						<li>To lower your diet’s footprint, consider transitioning to a vegan diet, or at least eating more vegan meals.</li>
						<li>Along with this, it’s important to focus on wasting less food.</li>
					</ol>
				</td>
				<td>
					<ol type="a">
						<li>Instead of sending food scraps (that includes things like vegetable peels, avocado pits, and spoiled leftovers) to landfill, start composting.</li> 
					</ol>
					<p>
						Composting is the process of returning anything that comes from nature to the earth, and letting it biodegrade into soil. Setting up a compost bin is super easy if you have a backyard, but it’s also possible if you live in an apartment or in a city with no yard.
					</p>
				</td>
				<td>
					<p>
						Reducing the use of plastic is important because plastic production requires an enormous amount of energy and resources. This causes carbon emissions and contributes to global warming. Recycling plastic is not efficient – only 9% of plastic ever produced has been recycled.
					</p>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<th>Transportation</th>
				<th>Shopping</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>
					<p>If you drive a gas-powered car every day, consider alternatives with lower emissions if they are available to you. For example:</p> 
               		<ol type="a">
               			<li>try walking, riding a bike, taking public transportation, carpooling, or investing in an electric or hybrid car when you need a new one</li>
               			<li>Additionally, many environmentalists have given up flying in airplanes (such as Greta Thunberg) due to the high environmental footprint, so consider traveling by train instead of by air when possible</li>
               		</ol>
				</td>
				<td>
					<p>The most sustainable form of shopping is not to shop at all — and the second most sustainable form (and more realistic form) of shopping is shopping secondhand.</p>
					<ol type="a">
						<li>Before buying anything new, check out your local thrift store, websites and apps like Poshmark, Craigslist, or eBay, or your local Buy Nothing group on Facebook</li>
						<li>When it comes to items that you can’t buy secondhand, seek out companies that make products from natural or recycled materials while following sustainable business practices</li>
					</ol>
				</td>

		<h2 class="center">Impact of Sustainable Living</h2>
		<p>When a community practices sustainable living, they help the environmental quality. Maintaining a sustainable lifestyle helps reduce your carbon footprint. When a community pursues sustainability, air pollution reduces. Clean air is key to a healthy community.</p>
	</div>
	<div id="what">
		<h2 class="center">What can people do?</h2>
		<ol type="i">
			<li><h3>Save energy.</h3>
			<p>By using less energy, you can help to reduce carbon emissions. There are a number of ways you can save energy at home, including switching off standby appliances, turning your heating down and hanging clothes to dry instead of using a drier.</p></li>
			<li><h3>Eat less meat.</h3>
			<p>The production of meat is one of the biggest contributors to climate change and the pollution of landscapes and waterways. By eating less of it, you can help to reduce the impact the meat industry has on the Earth.</p></li>
			<li><h3>Use reusable alternatives.</h3>
			<p>Single-use products, particularly plastic ones, tend to end up in landfill and the ocean, causing harm to wildlife and the environment. Prevent this by choosing to use reusable and eco-friendly alternatives instead.</p></li>
			<li><h3>Go paperless.</h3>
				<p>To avoid wasting paper, choose to receive letters over email and only print off documents if necessary. You could also ask shops to email you your receipt instead of printing it off.  </p></li>
			<li><h3>Use renewable energy.</h3>
				<p>If possible, consider powering your home using renewable energy to reduce the amount of carbon emissions you produce. Replacing your petrol or diesel-fuelled car with an electric one would also help to achieve this! </p></li>
			<li><h3>Recycle and reuse.</h3>
				<p>Make sure you’re recycling by putting your rubbish in the correct bins. Also, try to reuse products and items as many times as possible before binning them to reduce waste.</p></li>
			<li><h3>Grow your own produce.</h3>
				<p>By growing your own fruit and vegetables, you can ensure you’re not using pesticides that will contribute to water and air pollution. This will also help to reduce the amount fossil fuels used to transport produce to supermarkets.</p></li>
			<li><h3>Donate unused items.</h3>
				<p>If you don’t use a product or wear a piece of clothing anymore, give it to a charity shop or someone you know would make use of it to help reduce waste.</p></li>
