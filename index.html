		<h2 class="center">What is sustainable living?</h2>
		<p>Sustainable living is a practical philosophy that aims to reduce personal and societal environmental impact by making positive changes which counteract climate change and other negative environmental concerns.</p>
	</div>
	<div id="difference">
		<h2 class="center">Sustainable Living vs Zero Waste --- what's the difference?</h2>
		<p>The terms sustainable living and zero waste living are often used interchangeably. It’s easy to see why, because the two lifestyles are driven by the same goal – to preserve the planet. 

		Even in practice, there’s plenty of overlap. for example, reducing plastic is always good for the environment, so zero waste practices are inherently also sustainable living ones, too. On the flip side, those aiming for a zero waste lifestyle also tend to adopt other sustainable living habits. 
     
    	While driven by the same underlying motivation, zero waste and sustainable living prioritize lifestyle changes differently.

		Zero waste focuses on the trash problem (at the consumer level) and the closed-loop cycle of production and consumption (at the systematic level). It doesn’t specifically address things like transportation or green superannuation/pension funds to invest in. 

		Those things are domains of sustainable living, a much broader concept that deals with ways to reduce the environmental impact of large scale day-to-day activities that don’t necessarily produce quantifiable or physical forms of waste.</p>

	<div id="impact">
		<h2 class="center">Impact of Sustainable Living</h2>
		<p>When a community practices sustainable living, they help the environmental quality. Maintaining a sustainable lifestyle helps reduce your carbon footprint. When a community pursues sustainability, air pollution reduces. Clean air is key to a healthy community.</p>
	</div>
	<div id="what">
		<h2 class="center">What can people do?</h2>
		<p>
			Save energy. By using less energy, you can help to reduce carbon emissions.
			Eat less meat.
			Use reusable alternatives.
			Go paperless. 
			Use renewable energy.
			Recycle and reuse.
			Grow your own produce.
			Donate unused items.

		<img style="text-align: center;" src="venn.png" alt="Venn Diagram">
		<p>In more complex terms, sustainable living aims to achieve an environmental equilibrium. This is sometimes called “net zero living” or striking a “zero energy balance” with the Earth.
		In other words, return to the earth whatever you take from it. Obviously, this is sustainability in its ideal form. None of us will ever be able to truly achieve zero environmental impact. Which is why sustainability in its most broad sense also refers to how achievable that end is.  
		This is somewhat explained by the three pillars of sustainability illustrated by the venn diagram above from Penn State University. On the outside, we have the big three components: environmental, social, and economic.
		All three are connected by their subcircles and converging in the center of it all is true sustainability.
		We can’t have one without the others. 

		While environmental sustainability is first and foremost what we’re discussing, it’s important to bear in mind that without the economic and societal means it is vulnerable to collapse. </p>
